You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 11.

```
// Use the `getNext' method or 'next' property to get the following node.

node.getNext()
node.next
```
Note: do NOT mutate the nodes!
```
Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.
